- 👋 Hi, I’m @summersideup
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring web development technologies, particularly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in an online program with SheCodes, where I am honing my skills in front-end development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development, especially those that involve building landing pages etc.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at [ itssummersideup@gmail.com ]
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting in the kitchen and trying out new recipes. Cooking is another creative outlet for me , just like coding!
